# Bay Wheels Bike Share Data

## by Daniel Perez


## Dataset

The Bay Wheels dataset provides information about bike share trips made during Janury of 2020, comprised by users and bike routes info. Bay Wheels is a San Francisco bike share regional system owned by Lyft and operated by Motivate, and the database was extracted directly from Lyft's website

## Summary of Findings

After the exploration efforts, it became clear that the bike trips frequency has increased through January, reaching counts 5x bigger on the last days compared to the early ones. Most trips are composed by 6 to 15 minute rides, having the largest concentrations around 8 AM and 5 PM, close to the beginning and end of the work journey, probably indicating that bike share has been incorporated into daily routines. Furthermore, the two rental methods, App or Clipper card, show homogeneous growth throughout the month, and despite the App being the preferred choice, the importance of Clipper availability can be justified by several imaginable reasons. the Subscribers numbers have risen, proposing not a superficial but sturdy adoption of this transportation option. On the other hand, The Bike Share for All program, which is aimed to make bike share more accessible, has not followed the growth tendency, possibly rising an opportunity of features revision.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The presentation template was assembled with the goal of providing an easy-to-read and intuitive visualization of the findings. The graphs were chosen taking into consideration their fit to the purpose, with the violin plot possibly representing a more complex view, but which fulfill the necessity of representing the parameter mean in a correct form. Overall, the slide template was created to represent two main exploration lines, the trip routes and the users profiles, but also demonstrate regional and accessability findings.
